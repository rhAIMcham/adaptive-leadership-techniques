            <p>Hi team,</p>
            
            <p>I want to acknowledge upfront that we're working through an adaptive challenge right now: improving customer onboarding while our product, messaging and delivery timelines are all evolving. We don't have every detail locked in yet, but our intent is clear — we're simplifying the onboarding experience so customers reach value faster and our teams can deliver consistently.</p>
            
            <p class="section-heading">What we know (facts)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Customer feedback shows onboarding is taking too long and creating avoidable support demand.</li>
                <li>We have limited capacity this quarter, so we need a focused approach.</li>
                <li>The outcome we're accountable for is a clearer, faster onboarding journey with measurable improvement in completion and confidence.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="section-heading">What we don't know yet (still being worked out)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The final design of the full onboarding journey (we will refine this as we test and learn).</li>
                <li>The exact sequencing of all content and product changes beyond the next 4–6 weeks.</li>
                <li>Which improvements will have the highest impact until we run the first round of experiments.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p class="section-heading">What's changing and what isn't</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Changing:</strong> We're moving to smaller, faster releases and tighter collaboration between product, learning and marketing.</li>
                <li><strong>Not changing:</strong> Our commitment to quality, customer impact and respectful ways of working.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p class="section-heading">The trade-offs we're making (and why)</p>
            <p>To move faster and reduce confusion, we are choosing focus over breadth. That means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We will prioritise the top onboarding pain points first</li>
                <li>We will pause or de-scope lower-impact enhancements until we've stabilised the core flow.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This is not because those ideas aren't valuable — it's because doing everything at once slows progress and increases rework.</p>
            
            <p class="section-heading">I also want to name the human side of this</p>
            <p>Uncertainty can feel tiring, frustrating and even personal — especially when it changes how we work or what we're known for. If you're feeling change fatigue, concern about workload, or unclear on expectations, that's a normal response. The goal is to stay honest about what's hard while still moving forward together.</p>
            
            <p class="section-heading">Next steps (what we're doing now)</p>
            <p>This week we'll focus on three actions:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Confirm the top 3 onboarding friction points using customer and support insights</li>
                <li>Draft a v1 onboarding flow (simple, clear, testable)</li>
                <li>Run a short review to agree on one experiment to ship next</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Owners will be shared in Monday's stand-up so everyone knows what they own and what support is available.</p>
            
            <p class="section-heading">Space for questions and sensemaking</p>
            <p>We need reality from the frontline, not silent agreement. If something feels unclear, risky or misaligned, please raise it early.</p>
            <p>You can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bring questions to Thursday's 30-min drop-in Q&A (invite to follow)</li>
                <li>Share concerns directly with me or your team lead</li>
                <li>Add feedback to the onboarding working doc (link to follow)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p class="section-heading">Communication rhythm (so you're not guessing)</p>
            <p>To reduce noise, I'll send a weekly update every Friday with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What changed / what didn't</li>
                <li>What we learned</li>
                <li>What we're doing next week</li>
                <li>Any decisions made and trade-offs</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>And finally - credibility matters most right now: if we say we'll follow up, we will. If you raise a risk or concern, we'll close the loop with an answer or decision, even if that decision is "we don't know yet, here's when we will."</p>
            
            <p>Thanks for staying engaged through this. We'll navigate it by staying focused, honest and aligned on what matters.</p>

                <p>Regards,</p>
